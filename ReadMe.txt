Name Chord 1.0.1
The program will display chord name and matching scales for a group of
notes.
Input notes separated by a space and hit Enter to confirm the chord. The
notes must be in letter notation (A B C D E F G). The program only
understands capital letters and # (diesis), not b (bemolle). Bb must be
input as A#, a# will be ignored.
The program will display a chord name, using the first note entered as
the root and bass note, and all the matching scales. Input “q” to quit.
